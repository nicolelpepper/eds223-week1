## Set up workspace

```{r}
# Install packages
#install.packages("stars") # raster data
#install.packages("tmap") # mapping
#install.packages("viridisLite")

```

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(sf)
library(stars)
library(tmap)
library(here)
library(viridisLite)
```

## Bring in some spatial data

```{r}
# raster of global elevation
world_elevation <- read_stars(here("data","worldelevation.tif"))

# country boundaries
world_vector <- read_sf(here("data","worldvector.gpkg"))

# major cities
world_cities <- read_sf(here("data","worldcities.gpkg"))

```

## Make your first map!

```{r}
tm_shape(world_elevation)+
  tm_raster() +
tm_shape(world_vector) +
  tm_borders() +
tm_shape(world_cities) + 
  tm_dots()

```

```{r}
tm_shape(world_elevation, bbox = world_cities)+
  tm_raster() +
tm_shape(world_vector) +
  tm_borders() +
tm_shape(world_cities) + 
  tm_dots()
```

```{r}
tm_shape(world_vector) +
  tm_polygons(col = "lightblue",
              border.col = "black",
              lwd = 0.5,
              lty = "dashed")
```

```{r}
tm_shape(world_vector) + 
  tm_borders(col = "red")
```

```{r}
tm_shape(world_vector) + 
  tm_fill(col = "red")
```

```{r}
tm_shape(world_vector) + 
  tm_fill("gdp_per_cap")
```

```{r}
tm_shape(world_cities) +
  tm_dots()

```

```{r}

  tm_polygons("life_expectancy", 
              palette= c("yellow","green"),
              title = "Life Expectancy")
```

```{r}
```

```{r}

              palette = viridis(option = "magma", 8),

```

```{r}
